    title: "Hi there 👋"
    subtitle: "I’m Phakphum Artkaew, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computational Linguistics at Indiana University Bloomington, where I am fortunate to work with Luke Gessler. My research focuses on improving language models for low-resource languages by integrating insights from linguistics and cognitive science, with the broader goal of narrowing the gap between modern NLP systems and human language understanding.

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned my M.S. in Computer Engineering at NYU Tandon, where I completed a thesis co-advised by Ernest Davis and Chinmay Hegde. I also hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Penn State, where I conducted my senior thesis work in the Crowd-AI Lab under the supervision of Kenneth Huang.

Outside of research, I enjoy video games, movies, and exploring new places. I’m always happy to connect—whether you have questions about my work or just want to chat.

    Title: Hi there 👋
    Content: I'm Phakphum Artkaew, a PhD student majoring in computational linguistics at Indiana University Bloomington. My Thai nickname is Pluem, but I sometimes go by Peter for simplicity.<br>My research interests lie broadly in interpretability and analysis of models for NLP, psycholinguistics, machine translation and multilinguality, NLP applications, and machine learning for NLP. Specifically, I focus on cross-linguality and commonsense reasoning, with an emphasis on developing models that can understand and generate text in multiple languages.<br>When I am not working, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and exploring new places. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
