    Title: Hi there üëã
    Content: I‚Äôm Phakphum Artkaew, a master‚Äôs student majoring in Computer Engineering at New York University Tandon School of Engineering. My Thai nickname is Pluem, but I sometimes go by Peter for simplicity.<br> Prior to joining NYU, I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science from Pennsylvania State University, where I was advised by [Kenneth Huang](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/txh710) as part of the [Crowd-AI lab](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu).<br>I‚Äôm currently working on my master‚Äôs thesis, co-advised by Prof. Ernest Davis and Prof. Chinmay Hegde, focusing on commonsense reasoning and multilingual aspects.<br>My research interests lie broadly in interpretability and analysis of models for NLP, psycholinguistics, machine translation and multilinguality, NLP applications, and machine learning for NLP. Specifically, I focus on cross-linguality and commonsense reasoning, with an emphasis on developing models that can understand and generate text in multiple languages.<br>When I am not working, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and exploring new places. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
