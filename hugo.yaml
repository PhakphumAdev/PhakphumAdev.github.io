    Title: Hi there üëã
    Content: I‚Äôm Phakphum Artkaew, a master‚Äôs student majoring in Computer Engineering at New York University Tandon School of Engineering. My Thai nickname is Pluem, but I sometimes go by Peter for simplicity.<br> Prior to joining NYU, I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science from Pennsylvania State University, where I was advised by [Kenneth Huang](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/txh710) as part of the [Crowd-AI lab](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu).
