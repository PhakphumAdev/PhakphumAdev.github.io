    Title: Hi there üëã
    Content: I‚Äôm Phakphum Artkaew, a PhD student majoring in computational linguistics at Indiana University Bloomington. My Thai nickname is Pluem, but I sometimes go by Peter for simplicity.<br>My research interests lie broadly in interpretability and analysis of models for NLP, psycholinguistics, machine translation and multilinguality, NLP applications, and machine learning for NLP. Specifically, I focus on cross-linguality and commonsense reasoning, with an emphasis on developing models that can understand and generate text in multiple languages.<br>When I am not working, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and exploring new places. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
